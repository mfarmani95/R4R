### Rose:
Setting up a new environment and installing packages was a good review for me.

### Bud: 
How to deal with conflicts that we encounter during installation of new packages

### Thorn: 
I am trying to install the GDAL package in Python, and no matter how much I try, I cannot install it.

## Aditional
By chance, anyone knows a good Python package for regriding and resampling from 1D lat_lon to 2D lat-lon?
