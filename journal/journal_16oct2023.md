### Rose:
The review on how to use Git was really interesting. I had some experience with it, but the review enhanced my knowledge.

### Bud: 
I believe that we can make all the updates for the personal webpage on our local computer and then use commands to push them to the Git repository.

### Thorn: 
The session was very useful and informative.
